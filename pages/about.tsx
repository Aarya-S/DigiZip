            DigiZip simplifies and secures the process of document verification and sharing between two parties. To ensure that there are no unwanted delays in such a process, it has an encrypted and secure cloud-based store for documents. <br />
            We digitize the process of file sharing which has decentralized and encrypted store for better security and privacy of data. DigiZip allows users and organizations to send and request specific document pairings, and share them with ease.

            <Text css={{color:'$gray800', fontSize:'18px', letterSpacing:'0.2px', wordSpacing:'0.8px'}}>
            Almost all organisations worldwide use document copies to verification purposes; this process requires the client to provide them with sets of document pairings for validation and authentication purposes. <br /> These pairings most of the time are not well described and result in multiple rounds to submit the correct documents. 
            This traditional process also consumes a lot of paper and printer ink thus at some magnitude proving harmful to the environment. There is a dire need to fasten the process and also make it digital for the convenience of the user. Thus, DigiZip is made with intention to tackle and solve above issues and come out as a easy to use digital platform for document verification and sharing.

            <Text css={{color:'$gray800', fontSize:'18px', letterSpacing:'0.2px', wordSpacing:'0.8px'}}>
              DigiZip uses IPFS(Interplanetary File System) which is a protocol, hypermedia and file sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace. <br />
              IPFS allows users to host and receive content in a manner similar to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Any user in the network can serve a file by its content address, and other peers in the network can find and request that content from any node who has it using a distributed hash table (DHT).

              DigiZip which has its sole goal towards the secure storage and transfer of website and data of users does the following 2 things to ensure no duplicate or fake accounts are made - <br /><br />
              1. For USERS, while signing up on the platform, every user's identity is verified by using Aadhar ID and OTP. <br /><br />
              2. For ORGANIZATIONS, we ensure that while signing up on our platform the organization has to input unique registration number/ID provided by proper authority or government to them in the field in which they are operating, if they don not have any unique ID to prove their authenticity, we do not offer out platform to such organizations to avoid future complications.

              Other way which user can send their files is that the Organization can itself request them from the user and then the user will be notified about it and can send the specified files.
